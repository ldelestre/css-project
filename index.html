Ned Luke played Michael, providing voice acting and motion capture. Michael is aged in his 40s and is married to Amanda and father of Jimmy and Tracey. Each of the protagonists have special abilities that can be used during gameplay; Michael's ability is to enter bullet time in combat.</article>
		<article class="tab-2">Franklin Clinton is one of the three playable protagonists of Grand Theft Auto V. Shawn "Solo" Fonteno played Franklin, providing voice acting and motion capture. Part of the Chamberlain Gangster Families set of the Families gang, Franklin is a former gang banger who has ambitions to make big money, and realising he will not get that in the gang life, he works a semi-legitimate job as a repossession agent for Simeon Yetarian, who owns a luxury car dealership, alongside his best friend Lamar Davis. The special ability that Franklin can use is the ability to slow down time while driving.</article>
		<article class="tab-3">Trevor Philips is one of the three playable protagonists of Grand Theft Auto V. Steven Ogg played Trevor, providing voice acting and motion capture. Trevor is Canadian-American, born just north of the border and raised in the United States. He grew up with a physically abusive father and an emotionally abusive mother. While Michael and Franklin have the special ability to slow down time, Trevor's special ability is to deal out extra damage, and take less damage, and he can also perform a few unique melee attacks when the special meter is activated.</article>
